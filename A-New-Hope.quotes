               battle station: the Death Star!                 Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black                 conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around                 the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general,                 is speaking.                           operational we are vulnerable. The                           Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.                           They're more dangerous than you                           realize.                 The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.                           Commander, not to this battle station!                           a support in the Imperial Senate as                           long as....                 Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut                 short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial                 outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally,                 The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and                 bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his                 place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind                 him.                           be of any concern to us. I've just                           received word that the Emperor has                           dissolved the council permanently.                           The last remnants of the Old Republic                           have been swept away.                           Emperor maintain control without the                           bureaucracy?                           control over territories. Fear will                           keep the local systems in line. Fear                           of this battle station.                           Rebels have obtained a complete                           technical readout of this station,                           it is possible, however unlikely,                           that they might find a weakness and                           exploit it.                           back in our hands.                           this station would be a useless                           gesture, no matter what technical                           data they've obtained. This station                           is now the ultimate power in the                           universe. I suggest we use it!                           technological terror you've                           constructed. The ability to destroy                           a planet is insignificant next to                           the power of the Force.                           sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your                           sad devotion to that ancient religion                           has not helped you conjure up the                           stolen data tapes, or given you                           clairvoyance enough to find the                           Rebel's hidden fort...                 Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's                 spell.                              Vader will provide us with the                           location of the Rebel fortress by                           the time this station is operational.                           We will then crush the Rebellion                           with one swift stroke.                 The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas                 Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble                 and scattered bodies.                           all right. Look, here are Gaffi                           sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...                           I never heard of them hitting anything                           this big before.                 Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.                           think they did. These tracks are                           side by side. Sandpeople always ride                           single file to hide there numbers.                           us Artoo and Threepio.                           for Sandpeople. Only Imperial                           stormtroopers are so precise.                           slaughter Jawas?                 Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are                 inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.                           may have learned who they sold them                           to. And that would lead them home!                 Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for                 the speeder and jumps it.                  Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the                 burning Sandcrawler.                 Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.                 The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps                 out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home.                 Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great                 battle has taken place.                  Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle.                 Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is                 stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new                 resolve comes over him.                 Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.                 Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow                 several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is                 filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a                 giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.                           discuss the location of your hidden                           Rebel base.                 The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it                 approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical                 arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut                 and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled                 screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.                 There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of                 the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the                 dead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to                 him.                           Luke, had you been there. You'd have                           been killed, too, and the droids                           would be in the hands of the Empire.                           There's nothing here for me now. I                           want to learn the ways of the Force                           and become a Jedi like my father.                 The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it                 zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff                 overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard                 array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A                 harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts                 his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where                 Ben is standing.                           find a more wretched hive of scum                           and villainy. We must be cautious.                 Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined                 smile.                 The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat-                hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper                 questions Luke.                     Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while                 Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.                           identification.                           identification.                           for.                           for.                             Move along.                  The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina                 on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of                 transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are                 parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle                 the speeder.                           creatures.                 As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa                 away.                           we got by those troopers. I thought                           we were dead.                           on the weak-minded. You will find it                           a powerful ally.                           find a pilot here that'll take us to                           Alderaan?                           pilots can be found here. Only watch                           your step. This place can be a little                           rough.                   The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow                 Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy                 den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic                 alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At                 first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy,                 furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over                 drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group                 of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender                 stops Luke and the robots.                  Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many                 outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's                 drift.                            outside. We don't want them here.                 Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the                 Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures                 along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.                 Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.                           the speeder. We don't want any                           trouble.                  Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the                 creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.                 Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-                looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with                 fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-                covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.                  Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,                 and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a                 sight to behold.                 Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times                 during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets                 out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit                 disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between                 Ben and the giant Wookiee.                 Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips                 his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear                 or whatever.                 A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.                  The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore                 the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby                 Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the                 belligerent monstrosity.                    The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some                 unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young                 adventurer.                           yourself. We're wanted men. I have                           the death sentence in twelve systems.                   The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar                 moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His                 three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind                 Luke.                           effort. Come let me buy you                           something...                 A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young                 would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables                 and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid.                 With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked                 chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben.                 The bartender panics.                  With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life                 and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut                 in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled,                 cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns                 off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt.                 Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities,                 attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter                 of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is                 given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing                 his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben                 points the the Wookiee.                           on a ship that might suit our needs.                 Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on                 an electronic conversation with another little red astro-                droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches                 two stormtroopers in the street.                  Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking                 instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and                 follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is                 sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years                 old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental,                 and cocksure.                           Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells                           me you're looking for passage to the                           Alderaan system.                            Millennium Falcon?                            run in less than twelve parsecs!                 Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with                 obvious misinformation.                           the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.                           I'm talking about the big Corellian                           ships now. She's fast enough for                           you, old man. What's the cargo?                           two droids, and no questions asked.                           trouble?                           any Imperial entanglements.                           And it's going to cost you something                           extra. Ten thousand in advance.                           our own ship for that!                            pilot myself! We don't have to sit                           here and listen...                           could pay you two thousand now, plus                           fifteen when we reach Alderaan.                  Han ponders this for a few moments.                           We'll leave as soon as you're ready.                           Docking bay Ninety-four.                            take an interest in your handiwork.                 Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers                 looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some                 questions. The bartender points to the booth.                  The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben                 are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.                           really be desperate. This could really                           save my neck. Get back to the ship                           and get her ready.                            to this planet again.                 As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien                 with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature                 speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.                            was just going to see your boss.                           Tell Jabba that I've got his money.                 Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the                 gun on him.                           him when you had the chance. Jabba's                           put a price on your head, so large                           that every bounty hunter in the galaxy                           will be looking for you. I'm lucky I                           found you first.                            I found you.                            time for smugglers who drop their                           shipments at the first sign of an                           Imperial cruiser.                           think I had a choice?                 Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.                           only take your ship.                            forward to killing you for a long                           time.                  Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of                 light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as                 the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up                 and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some                 coins as he leaves.                  Several TIE fighters approach the Death Star.                           considerable. It will be some time                           before we can extract any information                           from her.                 An Imperial Officer interrupts the meeting.                           systems are operational. What course                           shall we set?                           alternative form of persuasion.                            the full power of this station.                               (to soldier)                          Set your course for Princess Leia's                           home planet of Alderaan.                  Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a                 narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking                 exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and                 robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and                 hiding from the hot winds.                  One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves                 on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and                 Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.                           street. It's secure. Move on to the                           next door.                 The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.                           Master Luke than stay here with you.                           I don't know what all the trouble is                           about, but I'm sure it must be your                           fault.                 Artoo makes beeping sounds.                  Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot,                 talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder                 dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass                 by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.                           Since the XP-38 came out, they're                           just not in demand.                  Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty                 alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like                 creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his                 faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature                 moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as                 they disappear down another alley.                           boasting, we ought to do well.                 Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple                 creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is                 the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is                 a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is                 a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and                 a huge ugly mouth.                  A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and                 they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee,                 Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.                              Han, my boy, there are times when                           you disappoint me... why haven't you                           paid me? And why did you have to fry                           poor Greedo like that... after all                           we've been through together.                            Han, why you're the best smuggler in                           the business. You're too valuable to                           fry. He was only relaying my concern                           at your delays. He wasn't going to                           blast you.                           don't send one of those twerps. If                           you've got something to say to me,                           come see me yourself.                           dump that shipment of spice... you                           understand I just can't make an                           exception. Where would I be if every                           pilot who smuggled for me dumped                           their shipment at the first sign of                           an Imperial starship? It's not good                           business.                           sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice,                           but I've got a charter now and I can                           pay you back, plus a little extra. I                           just need some more time.                           Put your blasters away. Han, my boy,                           I'm only doing this because you're                           the best and I need you. So, for an                           extra, say twenty percent I'll give                           you a little more time... but this                           is it. If you disappoint me again,                           I'll put a price on your head so                           large you won't be able to go near a                           civilized system for the rest of                           your short life.                           pleasure.                 Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay                 94.  Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.                  Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry.                 The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder                 lot.  He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small                 transmitter.                 Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is                 Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a                 large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that                 could only loosely be called a starship.                  The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.                           speed of light. She may not look                           like much, but she's got it where it                           counts, kid. I've added some special                           modifications myself.                 Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about                 all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others                 to follow.                           hurry aboard we'll get out of here.                 The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han                 Solo.                 Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty                 engines of the starship.                 Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium                 Falcon passing Solo.                  Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad                 creature.                  The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking                 bay.                  The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the                 docking bay entrance.                  Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing                 into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as                 he ducks into the spaceship.                  Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots                 which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The                 pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that                 slams the overhead entry shut.                  The group straps in for take off.                           hate space travel.                 The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general                 alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above                 the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the                 morning sky.                 Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who                 chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.                 The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.                 Han frantically types information into the ship's computer.                  Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway,                 makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.                           Our passengers must be hotter than I                           thought. Try and hold them off. Angle                           the deflector shield while I make                           the calculations for the jump to                           light speed.                 The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow                 planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial                 stardestroyers.                 Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy                 spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the                 cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.                           in; they're going to try to cut us                           off.                           you said this thing was fast.                           going to find yourself floating home.                           We'll be safe enough once we make                           the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I                           know a few maneuvers. We'll lose                           them!                 Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.                 The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.                            jump to light speed?                           coordinates from the navi-computer.                 The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.                           gaining...                           like dusting crops, boy! Without                           precise calculations we could fly                           right through a star or bounce too                           close to a supernova and that'd end                           your trip real quick, wouldn't it?                 The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red                 warning light begins to flash.                            Go strap yourself in, I'm going to                           make the jump to light speed.                 The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if                 crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship                 makes the jump to hyperspace.                 The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a                 second.                 Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation.                 Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before                 Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen                 displaying a small green planet.                  Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her                 hands are bound.                           expected to find you holding Vader's                           leash. I recognized your foul stench                           when I was brought on board.                           how hard I found it signing the order                           to terminate your life!                           take the responsibility yourself!                           I would like you to be my guest at a                           ceremony that will make this battle                           station operational. No star system                           will dare oppose the Emperor now.                           Tarkin, the more star systems will                           slip through your fingers.                           of this station. In a way, you have                           determined the choice of the planet                           that'll be destroyed first. Since                           you are reluctant to provide us with                           the location of the Rebel base, I                           have chosen to test this station's                           destructive power... on your home                           planet of Alderaan.                           weapons. You can't possibly...                           military target? Then name the system!                 Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.                           be the last time. Where is the Rebel                           base?                 Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to                 Alderaan.                           Dantooine.                 Leia lowers her head.                            be reasonable.                               (addressing Motti)                          Continue with the operation. You may                           fire when ready.                            is too remote to make an effective                           demonstration. But don't worry. We                           will deal with your Rebel friends                           soon enough.                   A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A                 hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.                  Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another                 lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A                 huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area                 and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan.                 The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.                 Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker"                 robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters,                 seems almost faint.                            Force... as if millions of voices                           suddenly cried out in terror and                           were suddenly silenced. I fear                           something terrible has happened.                 Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then                 he fixes his gaze on Luke.                           exercises.                 Han Solo enters the room.                           with those Imperial slugs. I told                           you I'd outrun 'em.                 Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.                  Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a                 game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move                 along a chess-type board.                           about oh-two-hundred hours.                 Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table                 covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the                 table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca                 seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur-                 covered arms over his head.                  Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his                 stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures                 to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's                 face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot.                 Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and                 begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.                           it won't help you.                           Let him have it. It's not wise to                           upset a Wookiee.                           upsetting a droid.                           people's arms out of their socket                           when they lose. Wookiees are known                           to do that.                           new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee                           win.                 Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems                 frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his                 head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.                  Han watches with a bit of smugness.                           flowing through him.                            commands.                 Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a                 "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae,                 hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of                 the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift                 lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't                 move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy,                 then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood                 red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing                 him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.                           are no match for a good blaster at                           your side, kid.                           you?                           this galaxy to the other. I've seen                           a lot of strange stuff, but I've                           never seen anything to make me believe                           there's one all-powerful force                           controlling everything. There's no                           mystical energy field that controls                           my destiny.                 Ben smiles quietly.                           nonsense.                  Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his                 eyes.                           self and act on instinct.                           With the blast shield down, I can't                           even see. How am I supposed to fight?                           trust them.                 Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker                 into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then                 drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly                 missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits                 Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful                 yell and attempts to hit the seeker.                  Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes                 a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the                 bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original                 position.                             thing as luck.                           one thing. Going good against the                           living? That's something else.                 Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the                 control panel.                           Alderaan.                 Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.                           could almost see the remote.                           first step into a larger world.                 Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the                 evil Dark Lord Darth Vader.                            Dantooine. They found the remains of                           a Rebel base, but they estimate that                           it has been deserted for some time.                           They are now conducting an extensive                           search of the surrounding systems.                            betray the Rebellion.                  The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange                 surreal light show surrounds the ship.                           the sublight engines.                 Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window                 stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then                 stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently                 shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering                 the sides of the ship.                           hyperspace into a meteor shower.                           Some kind of asteroid collision.                           It's not on any of the charts.                 The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool                 in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing                 cockpit.                            no, Alderaan!                            kid. It ain't there. It's been totally                           blown away.                  Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to                 settle down.                            the whole planet. It'd take a thousand                           ships with more fire power than                           I've...                 A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled                 alarm starts humming.                    Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside                 the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned                 Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.                             Where did it come from?                 The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship.                           If they identify us, we're in big                           trouble.                           it's transmissions.                           too far out of range.                  The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the                 vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.                 The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny                 fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter                 until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben                 stands behind Chewbacca.                           this deep into space on its own.                           of a convoy or something.                           long enough to tell anyone about us.                 The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as                 they race toward camera and disappear over head.                 The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or                 planet.                           small moon.                           there... he's almost in range.                 The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous                 spherical battle station.                              reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary                           power.                 The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away                 toward the gargantuan battle station.                            pulling us in!                           can do!                           kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to                           have to shut down. But they're not                           going to get me without a fight!                 Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.                           alternatives to fighting.                 As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome                 metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station                 becomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic                 sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which                 the helpless pirateship is dragged.                 The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port                 control room and huge laser turret cannons.                 Clear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic                 field.                 The pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death                 Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers                 stand at attention in a central assembly area.                                (to another officer)                          Come with me.                 Stormtroopers run to their posts.                 A line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in                 readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons                 ready to fire.                           all outboard shields!                 Tarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz.                            We've captured a freighter entering                           the remains of the Alderaan system.                           It's markings match those of a ship                           that blasted its way out of Mos                           Eisley.                           stolen plans to the princess. She                           may yet be of some use to us.                 Vader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and                 several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.                           Unlock one-five-seven and nine.                           Release charges.                           There's no one on board, sir.                           According to the log, the crew                           abandoned ship right after takeoff.                           It must be a decoy, sir. Several of                           the escape pods have been jettisoned.                            they must also have jettisoned.                           want every part of this ship checked.                            haven't felt since...                 Vader turns quickly and exits the hangar.                           the double. I want every part of                           this ship checked!                 A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In                 a few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant                 officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly                 pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his                 head out of a third locker.                           compartments.                           thought I'd be smuggling myself in                           them. This is ridiculous. Even if I                           could take off, I'd never get past                           the tractor beam.                            to say that!                           or the fool who follows him?                 Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees.                 The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the                 two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.                           pick up anything, report it                           immediately. All right, let's go.                 The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound                 is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.                           hand with this?                 The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire                 is heard.                 In a very small command office near the entrance to the                 pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices                 the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.                           your post? TX-four-one-two, do you                           copy?                 A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and                 waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating                 his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his                 head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an                 annoyed look.                           transmitter. I'll see what I can do.                 As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing                 the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary                 state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling                 howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow.                 The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted                 by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the                 robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed                 as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.                           your blasting everything in sight,                           it's a wonder the whole station                           doesn't know we're here.                           fight to all this sneaking around.                  Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of                 the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it                 carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.                  Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.                           interpret the entire Imperial computer                           network.                 Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the                 vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information                 to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.                           to power the tractor beam that's                           holding the ship here. He'll try to                           make the precise location appear on                           the monitor.                 The computer monitor flashes readouts.                           main reactor in seven locations. A                           power loss at one of the terminals                           will allow the ship to leave.                 Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.                           must go alone.                           that I bargained for on this trip                           already.                            over the droids.                            other star systems will suffer the                           same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny                           lies along a different path than                           mine. The Force will be with you...                           always!                 Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps                 out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey                 hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head                 in agreement.                  Han looks at Luke.                             trouble.                            just hanging around waiting for him                           to pick us up...                  Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.                  Luke goes over to him.                            He says "I found her", and keeps                           repeating, "She's here."                  Artoo whistles a frantic reply.                              three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to                           be terminated.                             one in the message... We've got to                           help her.                           The old man wants us to wait right                           here.                           Look, will you just find a way back                           into the detention block?                            a few minutes ago you said you didn't                           want to just wait here to be captured.                           Now all you want to do is stay.                           not what I had in mind.                    Chewbacca growls.                            were to rescue her, the reward would                           be...                             bit!                              right about this.                 Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.                             there will you?                 Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.                           you.                 Chewie lets out a hideous growl.                  Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.                           what he has in mind.                 The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as                 Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.                           asking... but, ah... what should                           Artoo and I do if we're discovered                           here?                    Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and                 start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.                 Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits                 as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops,                 bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio                 completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious                 glance.                 Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.                  A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away                 by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and                 the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.                 Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main                 passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot                 similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end                 of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then                 disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting                 that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion.                 No one in the hallway seems to notice him.                 Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door                 slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards                 enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates                 are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.                    Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches                 the trio.                  Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut                 up.                           three-eight.                           it.                 The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in                 the information. There are only three other troopers in the                 area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the                 alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of                 Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.                 Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one                 of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.                    The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and                 Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are                 blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of                 laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser                 gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the                 last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is                 about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink                 system, which is screeching questions about what is going                 on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.                           this princess of yours is in. Here                           it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.                           You go get her. I'll hold them here.                 Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into                 the buzzing comlink.                           Everything is under control. Situation                           normal.                            Uh... had a slight weapons                           malfunction. But, uh, everything's                           perfectly all right now. We're fine.                           We're all fine here, now, thank you.                           How are you?                            leak here now. Give us a few minutes                           to lock it down. Large leak... very                           dangerous.                           number?                 Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.                                (yelling down the                                hall)                          Luke! We're going to have company!                 Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door                 away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees                 the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping                 and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on                 her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands                 staring at her with his mouth hanging open.                           Aren't you a little short to be a                           stormtrooper?                 Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.                           Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.                            your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben                           Kenobi.                   Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the                 far end of the conference table.                            so?                           I felt it was in the presence of my                           old master.                            Force.                           gone out of the universe. You, my                           friend, are all that's left of their                           religion.                 There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.                            alert in detention block A A-twenty-                          three.                           alert!                           him.                           allowed to escape.                           him alone.                 An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the                 elevator door.                  Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.                  A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door                 through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.                 Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke                 and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting                 up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.                            our only escape route.                           Maybe you'd like it back in your                           cell, Your Highness.                 Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they                 continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their                 way down the corridor.                            Yes sir?                           other ways out of the cell bay?...                           What was that? I didn't copy!                 Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and                 whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink                 transmitter.                           to your presence, sir. The main                           entrance seems to be the only way in                           or out; all other information on                           your level is restricted.                 Someone begins banging on the door.                   Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as                 they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca                 are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far                 and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke                 fills the narrow cell corridor.                            what?                           in here, didn't you have a plan for                           getting out?                           He's the brains, sweetheart.                 Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.                  The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in                 the wall next to Han, almost frying him.                            the garbage chute, wise guy.                 She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca                 look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and                 says something.                           don't care what you smell! Get in                           there and don't worry about it.                 Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the                 tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their                 way toward the opening.                           kill her or I'm beginning to like                           her. Get in there!                 Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires                 off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then                 slides into the chute himself and is gone.                 Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.                  Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He                 finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't                 budge.                           Oh! The garbage chute was a really                           wonderful idea. What an incredible                           smell you've discovered! Let's get                           out of here! Get away from there...                  Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The                 laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.                  Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes                 almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a                 rather grim look on her face.                           it. It's magnetically sealed!                           get us all killed.                           had everything under control until                           you led us down here. You know, it's                           not going to take them long to figure                           out what happened to us.                  A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the                 murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins                 to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols                 drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.                              Look! Did you see that?                   Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.                  Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air                 and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around                 his throat.                  Leia extends a long pipe toward him.                     Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the                 muck by the slimy tentacle.                  Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and                 move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.                  Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca                 howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke                 suddenly bobs to the surface.                  Luke seems to be released by the thing.                            and disappeared...                           this.                 Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and                 edge toward the Rebels.                            it with something.                 They place poles and long metal beams between the closing                 walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant                 trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.                  Luke pulls out his comlink.                           Where could he be?                 A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for                 See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which                 is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and                 Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great                 explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the                 floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.                                (pointing to the dead                                officer)                          See to him! Look there!                 A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides                 open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows                 his bronze companion out into the office.                           the prison level. If you hurry, you                           might catch them.                           Follow me! You stand guard.                 The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to                 watch over the command office.                           Come on!                 The guard aims a blaster at them.                           the circuits of my counterpart here.                           If you don't mind, I'd like to take                           him down to maintenance.                  The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries                 out the door.                 As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.                  Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his                 giant paws.                 Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is                 snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.                  Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole.                 Leia begins to sink into the trash.                             will you come in?                           have happened to them. See if they've                           been captured.                 Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall                 socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from                 the tiny robot.                  The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against                 the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each                 other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds                 it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels                 the first crushing pressure against her body.                           to be a lot thinner!                               (to Leia)                          Get on top of it!                            Thank goodness, they haven't found                           them! Where could they be?                 Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.                           turned it off!                 Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his                 head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz                 and he rips it off his belt.                 Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard,                 but not distinctly.                              Will you shut up and listen to me?                           Shut down all garbage mashers on the                           detention level, will you? Do you                           copy?                           the detention level.                           Shut down all the garbage mashers on                           the detention level.                           No. Shut them all down! Hurry!                 Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible                 screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.                           Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast                           enough. It's all my fault! My poor                           master!                           Threepio, we're all right!                 The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief.                 The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace                 in the background.                  Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a                 number.                           maintenance hatch on unit number...                           where are we?                           Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.                 Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge                 tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep.                 The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard.                 The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading                 to a control panel that connects two large cables. He                 carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal,                 and several lights on the board go from red to blue.                 The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.                  Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster                 belts.                           advice, we ought to be able to get                           out of here.                 Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster                 from Solo.                  Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage                 room, as he runs away and then stops howling.                           Where are you going?                 The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy                 tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a                 victim. Han aims his pistol.                  Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes                 relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply                 shakes his head in disgust.                           Come here, you big coward!                 Chewie shakes his head "no."                            where you came from, but from now                           on, you do as I tell you. Okay?                 Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.                           one thing straight! I take orders                           from one person! Me!                                (looking at Chewie)                          Will somebody get this big walking                           carpet out of my way?                 Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.                  They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.                 Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of                 stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly                 slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few                 feet of him.                           canceled.                  All but two of the stormtroopers leave.                   Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers                 as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand                 toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the                 other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips                 past the troopers and into the main hallway.                            it.                 Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and                 stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers                 are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.                           There she is.                            For the moment. Uh, we're in the                           main hangar across from the ship.                  Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of                 the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and                 points out the window to the ship.                           that I thought.                  Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the                 hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty                 Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are                 taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.                  Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges                 the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the                 stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down                 the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.                           Get back to the ship!                  Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.                            himself killed? Come on!                 Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for                 muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke                 and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.                 Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is                 yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a                 dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few                 feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops                 begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are                 moving into an attack position in front of the lone                 starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops                 begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.                 Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt                 to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of                 laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate                 extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of                 furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running                 the other way also.                 Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down                 a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They                 quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an                 open hatchway.                 Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge                 that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity.                 The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft,                 and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance                 off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of                 his arm and pulls him back.                           I think we took a wrong turn.                 Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby                 reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at                 the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch                 that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving                 them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.                  Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.                  Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.                            the control that extends the bridge.                  Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the                 stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making                 ominous drilling and pounding sounds.                  Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when                 laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol                 at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across                 the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops                 appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit,                 and grabs at his chest.                 Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by                 Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move                 back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.                  Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt.                 It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge                 overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the                 rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears                 and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.                  Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet                 of more troops.                  Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and                 he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the                 gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He                 tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the                 princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him                 quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.                  Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss                 to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as                 Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the                 stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at                 the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into                 the tiny subhallway.                 Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several                 stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks                 to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the                 opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of                 the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.                 Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the                 pirateship entry ramp.                  Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left                 and right, beeping a response.                 Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several                 troopers hot on their trail.                  At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in                 front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion                 race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage                 to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops                 before the doors slam shut.                           doors!                 Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar                 where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar,                 Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not                 ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his                 and steps slowly forward.                           We meet again, at last. The circle                           is now complete.                 Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive                 position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.                           learner; now I am the master.                  The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few                 moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right                 moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain,                 as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He                 shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.                 Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked                 by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke                 by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's                 blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark                 Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar.                 The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments                 with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing                 sound.                            me down, I shall become more powerful                           than you can possibly imagine.                 Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.                 Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back                 against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the                 Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.                  Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.                              Just hope the old man got the tractor                           beam out of commission.                 Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they                 hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact.                 Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord                 of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his                 group's vantage point.                  Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader                 emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking                 bay.                 Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's                 Imperial docking bay.                  Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who                 were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards                 Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.                 Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The                 troops rush toward the battling knights.                  They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops                 charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader                 takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings                 his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to                 deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.                 The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts                 his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene                 look on his face.                 Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's                 cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.                  Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the                 empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers                 and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two                 and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.                  The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.                  The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium                 Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns                 their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and                 advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.                           Come on!                   Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it                 explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge                 forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close                 behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the                 docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his                 onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops,                 as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He                 fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.                  Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns                 toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the                 troopers and races into the ship.                 Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move.                 The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the                 ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.                           beam out if commission, or this is                           going to be a real short trip. Okay,                           hit it!                 Chewbacca growls in agreement.                 The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking                 bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness                 of space.                 Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off                 blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around                 him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She                 sits down beside him.                 Solo spots approaching enemy ships.                           We're coming up on the sentry ships.                           Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector                           shields while I charge up the main                           guns!                 Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth,                 as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.                  Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.                           done.                 Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the                 princess.                           Come on, buddy, we're not out of                           this yet!                 Solo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport.                 Luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads                 for the cockpit.                 Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling                 into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large                 rotating turrets on either side of the ship.                 Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of                 his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone.                           You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!                 Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking                 TIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls                 as the ship bounces slightly.                 Computer graphic readouts form on Solo's target screen, as                 Han reaches for controls.                 Luke sits in readiness for the attack, his hand on the laser                 cannon's control button.                 Chewbacca spots the enemy ships and barks.                           Here they come!                 The Imperial TIE fighters move towards the Millennium Falcon,                 one each veering off to the left and right of the pirateship.                 The stars whip past behind the Imperial pilot as he adjusts                 his maneuvering joy stick.                 The TIE fighter races past the Falcon, firing laser beams as                 it passes.                 Threepio is seated in the hold area, next to Artoo-Detoo.                 The pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in                 the room and then comes back on.                 A TIE fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and                 fires at it with the laser cannon. Luke does likewise, as                 the fighter streaks into view. The ship has suffered a minor                 hit, and bounces slightly.                 Two TIE fighters dive down toward the pirateship.                 Luke fires at an unseen fighter.                  Pan with pirateship as two TIE fighters charge through the                 background. Laserbolts streak from all the craft.                 The ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the                 cockpit. The Wookiee chatters something to Leia.                 Full shot of a TIE fighter as it moves fast through the frame,                 firing on the pirate starship.                 The two TIE fighters fire a barrage of laserbeams at the                 pirateship.                 A laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The                 ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet                 fill of small computer chips.                  Leia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates                 the ship's controls.                   An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel,                 causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.                           You hear me, baby? Hold together!                 Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control                 panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant                 beeping all the while.                 Luke swivels in his gun mount, following the TIE fighter                 with his laser cannon.                 Solo aims his laser cannon at the enemy fighter.                 A TIE fighter streaks in front of the starship.                 Leia watches the TIE fighter ship fly over.                 A TIE fighter heads right for the pirateship, then zooms                 overhead.                 Luke follows the TIE fighter across his field of view, firing                 laserbeams from his cannon.                 A TIE fighter dives past the pirateship.                 Luke fires at a TIE fighter. At his port, Han follows a                 fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He                 connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han laughs                 victoriously.                 Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon,                 unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship.                 Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke,                 smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular                 direct hit.                  Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully                 returns.                  Han turns back to his laser cannon.                 Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship.                 While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking                 over her shoulder out the ports.                           there!                 A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts                 at it.                 Luke and Han look into their respective projected target                 screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han                 swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser                 cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts                 in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his                 face.                 The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing                 destructive blasts at it.                 Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter,                 and it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke's projected                 screen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces                 slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire.                 The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in,                 firing upon the Falcon.                 Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc                 of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the                 pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon                 hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower                 of burning fragments.                           That's it! We did it!                 The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.                  Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled                 in the smoking, sparking wires.                                (to Artoo)                          This is all your fault.                 Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response.                 The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically                 through space.                 Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is                 watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him.                            hyperspace.                           secure aboard their ship? I'm taking                           an awful risk, Vader. This had better                           work.                 Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of                 the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the                 damage. Leia is seated near Han.                           know, sometimes I even amaze myself.                           they let us go. It's the only                           explanation for the ease of our                           escape.                    Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.                           still intact.                           carrying?                           station. I only hope that when the                           data is analyzed, a weakness can be                           found. It's not over yet!                           in this for your revolution, and I'm                           not in it for you, Princess. I expect                           to be well paid. I'm in it for the                           money!                           If money is all that you love, then                           that's what you'll receive!                 She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit,                 passes Luke coming in.                           wonder if he really cares about                           anything... or anyone.                  Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han                 stare out at the vast blackness of space.                             Good...                           don't know, what do you think? Do                           you think a princess and a guy like                           me...                  Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at                 young Luke's jealousy.                 The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet                 Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.                 The pirateship soars over the dense jungle.                 An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside.                  He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely                 visible in the foliage.                 Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple                 lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the                 fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the                 others are greeted by the Rebel troops.                 Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored                 military speeder.                 The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set                 up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the                 commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and                 gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.                           You're safe! We had feared the worst.                 Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.                           were afraid that you were... lost                           along with your father.                           Commander. The battle station has                           surely tracked us here.                               (looking pointedly to                                Han)                          It's the only explanation for the                           ease of our escape. You must use the                           information in this R2 unit to plan                           the attack. It is our only hope.                 The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red                 planet Yavin.                 Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their                 discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer                 the call.                  We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a                 moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.                 A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape,                 surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of                 twisted green.                 Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia                 and several other senators are to one side of the giant                 readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots,                 navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is                 listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and                 Chewbacca are standing near the back.                           and carries a firepower greater than                           half the star fleet. It's defenses                           are designed around a direct large-                          scale assault. A small one-man fighter                           should be able to penetrate the outer                           defense.                 Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands                 and addresses Dodonna.                           good are snub fighters going to be                           against that?                           small one-man fighter to be any                           threat, or they'd have a tighter                           defense. An analysis of the plans                           provided by Princess Leia has                           demonstrated a weakness in the battle                           station.                 Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping                 sounds, and turns his head from right to left.                           are required to maneuver straight                           down this trench and skim the surface                           to this point. The target area is                           only two meters wide. It's a small                           thermal exhaust port, right below                           the main port. The shaft leads                           directly to the reactor system. A                           precise hit will start a chain                           reaction which should destroy the                           station.                 A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.                           chain reaction. The shaft is ray-                          shielded, so you'll have to use proton                           torpedoes.                 Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about                 sixteen years old.                           computer.                           eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back                           home. They're not much bigger than                           two meters.                           with you!                 The group rises and begins to leave.                 The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the                 tiny green moon.                 Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with                 interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another                 on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and                 the forth moon.                 Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the                 Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.                           It has seen the end of Kenobi and it                           will soon see the end of the                           Rebellion.                 Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship                 hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.                  Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and                 unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this                 activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes                 onto an armored speeder.                           All flight trooper, man your stations.                           All flight troops, man your stations.                 Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter                 pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of                 his friend's departure.                           just leaving then?                           debts I've got to pay off with this                           stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't                           think I'd be fool enough to stick                           around here, do you? Why don't you                           come with us? You're pretty good in                           a fight. I could use you.                           Come on! Why don't you take a look                           around? You know what's about to                           happen, what they're up against.                           They could use a good pilot like                           you. You're turning your back on                           them.                           around to use it? Besides, attacking                           that battle station ain't my idea of                           courage. It's more like suicide.                           yourself, Han. I guess that's what                           you're best at, isn't it?                 Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.                           you!                 Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in                 a small wave and then goes off.                 Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,                           I'm doing.                 Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.                            thought he'd change his mind.                           one can choose it for him.                  Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke                 heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs                 his arm.                           get here... are you going out with                           us?!                           with you! Listen, have I got some                           stories to tell...                 Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up                 behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born                 leader.                           been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-                          five?                           the outer rim territories.                 Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of                 his fighter.                           just a boy, he was a great pilot.                           You'll do all right. If you've got                           half of your father's skill, you'll                           do better than all right.                  Red Leader hurries to his own ship.                           tell me your stories when we come                           back. All right?                            You did, all right. It's going to be                           like old times, Luke. We're a couple                           of shooting stars that'll never be                           stopped!                 Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for                 his ship.                 As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly                 spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points                 to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the                 back of the fighter.                           beat up. Do you want a new one?                           and I have been through a lot                           together.                               (to Artoo)                          You okay, Artoo?                 The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of                 the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps                 that he is fine.                 Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an                 his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive                 hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner                 into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo                 beeps good-bye.                            come back.                 Artoo beeps in agreement.                           boring, would you?                 Artoo whistles his reply.                 All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.                  The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the                 pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The                 hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted                 voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses                 are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit                 shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman,                 holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace                 of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.                  Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.                 All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing                 on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The                 muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this                 eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion                 rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage                 in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud                 cover.                 The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly                 before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its                 four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves                 ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appear                 around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills                 the war room.                           approaching. Estimated time to firing                           range, fifteen minutes.                 The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface                 of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying                 in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.                 Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow                 around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in                 formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly                 pull away.                 Red Leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights,                 looking to each side at his wing men.                  One of the Rebel fighters checks in through his mike.                  Biggs checks his fighter's controls, alert and ready for                 combat.                           Red Seven standing by.                             Red Nine standing by.                            Red Eleven standing by.                  Artoo-Detoo, in position outside of the fighter, turns his                 head from side to side and makes beeping sounds.                  The group of X-wing fighters move in formation toward the                 Death Star, unfolding the wings and locking them in the "X"                 position.                           We're passing through their magnetic                           field.                  Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the                 approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted                 slightly.                           Switch your deflectors on.                           Double front!                 The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The                 Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in                 size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the                 metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna                 is built into the surface on one side.                 Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome                 spectacle.                            Cut the chatter, Red Two.                           it, boys!                 As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome                 size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half                 of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area                 sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines                 and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a                 city at night as seen from a weather satellite.                            I copy, Gold Leader.                           now.                 Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming                 in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in                 the background. He moves his computer targeting device into                 position.                           across the axis and try and draw                           their fire.                 Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive                 towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across                 the dark grey expanse of the huge station.                 Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo-                 powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate                 the huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting                 devices.                 Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-                wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death                 Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and                 fires.                 Princess Leia listens to the battle over the intercom.                  Threepio is at her side.                                system)                          Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees.                           I see it. Stay low.                 An X-wing zooms across the surface of the Death Star.                 Technical crews scurry here and there loading last-minute                 armaments and unlocking power cables.                 Wedge maneuvers his fighter toward the menacing Death Star.                 X-wings continue in their attack course on the Death Star.                 Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous                 fortress. The Death Star surface streaks past the cockpit                 window.                  Luke's X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts streak                 from Luke's weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on                 the dim surface.                 Terror crosses Luke's face as he realizes he won't be able                 to pull out in time to avoid the fireball.                           Luke, pull up!                 Luke's ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges                 of his wings slightly scorched.                  Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief.                 Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.                  Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface                 with laserbolts.                 Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in                 all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.                  Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and                 foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes                 up to him.                           Vader. But they're so small they're                           evading our turbo-lasers!                           ship. Get the crews to their fighters.                 Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their                 turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes                 about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head                 gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming                 noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet                 with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.                 Red Leader flies through a heavy hail of flak.                           in.                 The Red Leader's X-wing flies past Luke as he puts his nose                 down and starts his attack dive.                            fire coming from the right side of                           that deflection tower.                  Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon                 and down onto the dim grey surface.                 A shot hurls from Luke's guns. Laserbolts streak toward the                 onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar emplacements                 erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a protruding tower on                 the surface.                 The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit window                 as a big smile sweeps across Luke's face at the success of                 his run. Flak thunders on all sides of him.                 The Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he maneuvers                 his craft through a wall of laserfire and peels away from                 the surface towards the heavens.                 The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout                 the massive structure. Many soldiers rush about in the smoke                 and chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual flash of                 explosions.                 Biggs dives through a forest of radar domes, antennae, and                 gun towers as he shoots low across the Death Star surface. A                 dense barrage of laserfire streaks by on all sides.                 Imperial star pilots dash in unison to a line of small                 auxiliary hatches that lead to Imperial TIE fighters.                 Princess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces                 nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides                 technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna                 watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working                 over a screen speaks into his headset.                           group of signals. Enemy fighters                           coming your way.                 Luke looks around to see if he can spot the approaching                 Imperial fighters.                           anything.                 The Death Star's surface sweeps past as Red Leader searches                 the sky for the Imperial fighters. Flak pounds at his ship.                           all this jamming, they'll be on top                           of you before your scope can pick                           them up.                 Silhouetted against the rim lights of the Death Star horizon,                 four ferocious Imperial TIE ships dive on the Rebel fighters.                  Two of the TIE fighters peel off and drop out of frame. Pan                 with the remaining two TIE ships.                 Biggs panics when he discovers a TIE ship on his tail. The                 horizon in the background twists around as he peels off,                 hoping to lose the Imperial fighter.                           it!                  Biggs zooms off the surface and into space, closely followed                 by an Imperial TIE fighter. The TIE ship fires several                 laserbolts at Biggs, but misses.                 Biggs see the TIE ship behind him and swings around, trying                 to avoid him.                           I can't shake him.                 Biggs, flying at high altitude, peels off and dives toward                 the Death Star surface, but he is unable to lose the TIE                 fighter, who sticks close to his tail.                 Luke is flying upside down. He rotates his ship around to                 normal attitude as he comes out of his dive.                  Biggs and the tailing TIE ship dive for the surface, now                 followed by a fast-gaining Luke. After Biggs dives out of                 sight, Luke chases the Imperial fighter.                 In the foreground, the Imperial fighter races across the                 Death Star's surface, closely followed by Luke in the                 background.                 There is a shot from Luke's X-wing of the TIE ship exploding                 in a mass of flames.                  Darth Vader strides purposefully down a Death Star corridor,                 flanked by Imperial stormtroopers.                           from the main group. Come with me!                 A concerned Princess Leia, Threepio, Dodonna, and other                 officers of the Rebellion stand around the huge round readout                 screen, listening to the ship-to-ship communication on the                 room's loudspeaker.                           Pull in! Luke... pull in!                           Watch your back, Luke!                           Watch your back! Fighter's above                           you, coming in!                 Luke's ship soars away from the Death Star's surface as he                 spots the tailing TIE fighter.                 The TIE pilot takes aim at Luke's X-wing.                 The Imperial TIE fighter pilot scores a hit on Luke's ship.                  Fire breaks out on the right side of the X-wing.                 Luke looks out of his cockpit at the flames on his ship.                  Smoke pours out from behind Artoo-Detoo.                           Hang on back there.                 Green laserfire moves past the beeping little robot as his                 head turns.                 Luke nervously works his controls.                           Red Six...                 In the war room, Leia stands frozen as she listens and worries                 about Luke.                           Can you see Red Five?                           There's a heavy fire zone on this                           side. Red Five, where are you?                 Luke spots the TIE fighter behind him and soars away from                 the Death Star surface.                  Luke's ship soars closer to the surface of the Death Star,                 an Imperial TIE fighter closing in on him in hot pursuit.                 The Death Star whips below Wedge.                            Hold on!                 Wedge dives across the horizon toward Luke and the TIE                 fighter.                 Wedge moves his X-wing in rapidly.                 Luke reacts frantically.                  The fighter pilot watches Wedge's X-wing approach. Another X-                wing joins him, and both unleash a volley of laserfire on                 the Imperial fighter.                 The TIE fighter explodes, filling the screen with white light.                  Luke's ship can be seen far in the distance.                 Luke looks about in relief.                  Leia, Threepio, Dodonna and other Rebel officers are listening                 to the Rebel Fighter's radio transmissions over the war room                 intercom.                           Good shooting, Wedge!                           Red Leader...                 Gold Leader peels off and starts toward the long trenches at                 the Death Star surface pole.                           out attack run.                 Three Y-wing fighters of the Gold group dive out of the stars                 toward the Death Star surface.                 Leia and the others are grouped around the screen, as                 technicians move about attending to their duties.                           I copy, Gold Leader. Move into                           position.                 Three Imperial TIE ships in precise formation dive toward                 the Death Star surface.                 Darth Vader calmly adjusts his control stick as the stars                 whip past in the window above his head.                  Technicians are seated at the computer readout table.                           The exhaust post is...                  Gold Leader approaches the surface and pulls out to skim the                 surface of the huge station. The ship moves into a deep                 trench, firing laserbolts. The surface streaks past as                 laserfire is returned by the Death Star.                 Gold Five is a pilot in his early fifties with a very battered                 helmet that looks like it's been through many battles. He                 looks around to see if enemy ships are near. His fighter is                 buffeted by Imperial flak.                 Gold Leader races down the enormous trench that leads to the                 exhaust port. Laserbolts blast toward him in increasing                 numbers, occasionally exploding near the ship causing it to                 bounce about.                           screens.                 Three Y-wing skim the Death Star surface deep in the trench,                 as laserbolts streak past on all sides.                 An exterior surface gun blazes away at the oncoming Rebel                 fighters.                           Five.                           I'd say about twenty guns. Some on                           the surface, some on the towers.                 Leia, Threepio, and the technicians view the projected target                 screen, as red and blue target lights glow. The red target                 near the center blinks on and off.                           Death Star will be in range in five                           minutes.                 The three Y-wing fighters race toward camera and zoom overhead                 through a hail of laserfire.                 Gold Leader pulls his computer targeting device down in front                 of his eye. Laserbolts continue to batter the Rebel craft.                  Gold Two, a younger pilot about Luke's age, pulls down his                 targeting eye viewer and adjusts it. His ship shudders under                 intense laser barrage.                  As the fighters begin to approach the target area, suddenly                 all the laserfire stops. An eerie clam clings over the trench                 as the surface whips past in a blur.                  Gold Five looks behind him.                           for enemy fighters.                           two ten.                 Three Imperial TIE ships, Darth Vader in the center flanked                 by two wingmen, dive in precise formation almost vertically                 toward the Death Star surface.                 Darth Vader calmly adjusts his control stick as the stars                 zoom by.                            Yes, sir.                 Three TIE fighters zoom across the surface of the Death Star.                 Vader lines up Gold Two in his targeting computer. Vader's                 hands grip the control stick as he presses the button.                 The cockpit explodes around Gold Two. His head falls forward.                 As Gold Two's ship explodes, debris is flung out into space.                 Gold Leader looks over his shoulder at the scene.                 The three TIE fighters race along in the trench in a tight                 formation.                 Gold Leader panics.                           I can't maneuver!                 Gold Five, the old veteran, trys to calm Gold Leader.                  The Death Star races by outside the cockpit window as he                 adjusts his targeting device.                  The older pilot remains calm.                  Now he's really panicked.                  Vader calmly adjusts his targeting computer and pushes the                 fire button.                 Gold Leader's ship is hit by Vader's laser.                 Gold Leader explodes in a ball of flames, throwing debris in                 all directions.                 Gold Five moves in on the exhaust port.                  Luke looks over his shoulder at the action outside of his                 cockpit.                           Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.                   One of the engines explodes on Gold Five's Y-wing fighter,                 blazing out of control. He dives past the horizon toward the                 Death Star's surface, passing a TIE fighter during his                 descent. Gold Five, a veteran of countless campaigns, spins                 toward his death.                 Luke looks nervously about him at the explosive battle.                 Grant Moff Tarkin and a Chief Officer stand in the Death                 Star's control room.                           and there is a danger. Should I have                           your ship standing by?                           I think you overestimate their                           chances!                 Tarkin turns to the computer readout screen. Flames move                 around the green disk at the center of the screen, as numbers                 read across the bottom.                           Rebel base, three minutes and closing.                 Red Leader looks over at his wingmen.                  Dodonna moves to the intercom as he fiddles with the computer                 keys.                           Rendezvous at mark six point one.                           This is Red Two. Flying toward you.                           Red Three, standing by.                           Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep                           half your group out of range for the                           next run.                           Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two                           and Three. Hold up here and wait for                           my signal... to start your run.                 Luke nods his head.                 The X-wing fighters of Luke, Biggs, and Wedge fly in formation                 high above the Death Star's surface.                 Luke peers out from his cockpit.                 Two X-wings move across the surface of the Death Star. Red                 Leader's X-wing drops down to the surface leading to the                 exhaust port.                 Red Leader looks around to watch for the TIE fighters. He                 begins to perspire.                  Red Leader roams down the trench of the Death Star as lasers                 streak across the black heavens.                 A huge remote-control laser cannon fires at the approaching                 Rebel fighters.                 The Rebel fighters evade the Imperial laser blasts.                 Red Ten looks around for the Imperial fighters.                  From the cockpits of the Rebel pilots, the surface of the                 Death Star streaks by, with Imperial laserfire shooting toward                 them.                           fighters!                  Three X-wing fighters move in formation down the Death Star                 trench.                           you are?                 Luke looks down at the Death Star surface below.                  Red Ten looks up and sees the Imperial fighters.                           Coming in point three five.                  Three TIE fighters, Vader flanked by two wingmen, dive in a                 tight formation. The sun reflects off their dominate solar                 fins as they loop toward the Death Star's surface.                 Red Leader pulls his targeting device in front of his eyes                 and makes several adjustments.                  Red Leader's X-wing moves up the Death Star trench.                  Red Leader looks at his computer target readout screen. He                 then looks into his targeting device.                  Vader adjusts his control lever and dives on the X-wing                 fighters.                  The three TIE fighters move in formation across the Death                 Star surface.                 Red Leader lines up his target on the targeting device cross                 hairs.                 Vader and his wingmen zoom down the trench.                 Vader rapidly approaches the two X-wings of Red Ten and Red                 Twelve. Vader's laser cannon flashes below the view of the                 front porthole. the X-wings show in the center of Vader's                 computer screen.                 Red Twelve's X-wing fighter is hit by Vader's laserfire, and                 it explodes into flames against the trench.                 Red Ten works at his controls furiously, trying to avoid                 Vader's fighter behind him. 
               RED TEN: You'd better let her loose.                 Red Leader is concentrating on his targeting device.                  Red Ten panics.                  Vader and his wingmen whip through the trench in pursuit of                 the Rebel fighters.                 Vader cooly pushes the fire button on his control stick.                 Darth Vader's well-aimed laserfire proves to be unavoidable,                 and strikes Red Ten's ship. Red Ten screams in anguish and                 pain.                 Red Ten's ship explodes and bursts into flames.                 Grimly, Red Leader takes careful aim and watches his computer                 targeting device, which shows the target lined up in the                 cross hairs, and fires.                  An armed Imperial stormtrooper is knocked to the floor from                 the attack explosion. Other troopers scurrying about the                 corridors are knocked against the wall and lose their balance.                 Leia and the others stare at the computer screen.                           It's a hit!                           Negative.                 Red Leader looks back at the receding Death Star. Tiny                 explosions are visible in the distance.                           impacted on the surface.                 Darth Vader peels off in pursuit as Red Leader's X-wing passes                 the Death Star horizon.                 Vader swings his ship around for the next kill.                           Red Leader, we're right above you.                           Turn to point...                 Luke tries to spot Red Leader. He looks down at the Death                 Star surface.                            Stay there...                 A wary Red Leader looks about nervously.                  Luke looks excitedly toward Red Leader's X-wing.                           Get set to make your attack run.                 Vader's gloved hands make contact with the control sticks,                 and he presses their firing buttons.                 Red Leader fights to gain control of his ship.                 Laserbolts are flung from Vader's TIE fighter, connecting                 with Red Leader's Rebel X-wing fighter. Red Leader buys it,                 creating a tremendous explosion far below. He screams and is                 destroyed.                 Luke looks out the window of his X-wing at the explosion far                 below. For the first time, he feels the helplessness of his                 situation.                 Grand Moff Tarkin casts a sinister eye at the computer screen.                  Dodonna and Princess Leia, with Threepio beside them, listen                 intently to the talk between the pilots. The room is grim                 after Red Leader's death. Princess Leia nervously paces the                 room.                           Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.                           We're going in. We're going in full                           throttle.                 The horizon twists as Wedge begins to pull out.                  The two X-wings peel off against a background of stars and                 dive toward the Death Star.                           to pull out in time?                           back home.                 The three X-wings move in, unleashing a barrage of laserfire.                  Laserbolts are returned from the Death Star.                 Luke's lifelong friend struggles with his controls.                           you.                 Flak and laserbolts flash outside Luke's cockpit window.                           My scope shows the tower, but I can't                           see the exhaust port! Are you sure                           the computer can hit it?                 The Death Star laser cannon slowly rotates as it shoots                 laserbolts.                 Luke looks around for the Imperial TIE fighters. He thinks                 for a moment and then moves his targeting device into                 position.                           throttle!                 Wedge looks excitedly about for any sign of the TIE fighters.                            worry about the tower!                 Luke's X-wing streaks through the trench, firing lasers.                 Luke breaks into a nervous sweat as the laserfire is returned,                 knicking one of his wings close to the engine.                           Artoo... that, that stabilizer's                           broken loose again! See if you can't                           lock it down!                 Artoo works to repair the damages. The canyon wall rushes by                 in the background, making his delicate task seem even more                 precarious.                 Two laser cannons are firing on the Rebel fighters.                 Wedge looks up and sees the TIE ships.                 Luke's targeting device marks off the distance to the target.                 Vader and his wingmen zoom closer.                 Vader adjusts his controls and fires laserbolts at two X-                wings flying down the trench. He scores a direct hit on Wedge.                 Leia and the others are grouped around the computer board.                           I'm hit! I can't stay with you.                           Get clear, Wedge.                   Wedge pulls his crippled X-wing back away from the battle.                 Vader watches the escape but issues a command to his wingmen.                  Luke's X-wing speeds down the trench; the three TIE fighters,                 still in perfect unbroken formation, tail close behind.                 Biggs looks around at the TIE fighters. He is worried.                           faster this time. I can't hold them!                 The three TIE fighters move ever closer, closing in on Luke                 and Biggs.                 Luke looks back anxiously at little Artoo.                  Ignoring the bumpy ride, flak, and lasers, a beeping Artoo-                Detoo struggles to increase the power, his dome turning from                 side to side.                 Stealthily, the TIE formation creeps closer.                 Vader adjusts his control stick.                 Biggs looks around at the TIE fighters.                 Luke looks into his targeting device. He moves it away for a                 moment and ponders its use. He looks back into the computer                 targeter.                           Hurry up, Luke!                 Vader and his wingmen race through the Death Star trench.                  Biggs moves in to cover for Luke, but Vader gains on him.                 Biggs sees the TIE fighter aiming at him.                  Vader squeezes the fire button on his controls.                 Biggs' cockpit explodes around him, lighting him in red.                 Biggs' ship bursts into a million flaming bits and scatters                 across the surface.                 Leia and the others stare at the computer board.                 Luke is stunned by Biggs' death. His eyes are watering, but                 his anger is also growing.                 Grand Moff Tarkin watches the projected target screen with                 satisfaction.                           closing.                 Vader takes aim on Luke and talks to the wingmen.                  Luke's ship streaks through the trench of the Death Star.                 Princess Leia returns her general's worried and doubtful                 glances with solid, grim determination. Threepio seems                 nervous.                  Luke concentrates on his targeting device.                 Three TIE fighters charge away down the trench toward Luke.                 Vader's finger's curls around the control stick.                 Luke adjusts the lens of his targeting device.                 Luke's ship charges down the trench.                 Luke lines up the yellow cross-hair lines of the targeting                 device's screen. He looks into the targeting device, then                 starts at a voice he hears.                  The Death Star trench zooms by.                 Luke looks up, then starts to look back into the targeting                 device. He has second thoughts.                  A grim determination sweeps across Luke's face as he closes                 his eyes and starts to mumble Ben's training to himself.                 Luke's fighter streaks through the trench.                  Vader follows Luke's X-wing down the trench.                 Luke looks to the targeting device, then away as he hears                 Ben's voice.                  Luke's hand reaches for the control panel and presses the                 button. The targeting device moves away.                 Leia and the others stand watching the projected screen.                           His computer's off. Luke, you switched                           off your targeting computer. What's                           wrong?                           Nothing. I'm all right.                 Luke's ship streaks ever close to the exhaust port.                 Luke looks at the Death Star surface streaking by.                 Artoo-Detoo turns his head from side to side, beeping in                 anticipation.                 The three TIE fighters, manned by Vader and his two wingmen,                 follow Luke's X-wing down the trench.                 Vader maneuvers his controls as he looks at his doomed target.                  He presses the fire buttons on his control sticks. Laserfire                 shoots toward Luke's X-wing fighter.                 A large burst of Vader's laserfire engulfs Artoo. The arms                 go limp on the smoking little droid as he makes a high-pitched                 sound.                 Luke looks frantically back over his shoulder at Artoo.                 Smoke billows out around little Artoo and sparks begin to                 fly.                  Artoo's beeping sounds die out.                 Leia and the others stare intently at the projected screen,                 while Threepio watches the Princess. Lights representing the                 Death Star and targets glow brightly.                           The Death Star has cleared the planet.                 Tarkin glares at the projected target screen.                    An officer reaches up and pushes buttons on the control panel,                 as green lighted buttons turn to red.                 The three TIE fighters zoom down the Death Star trench in                 pursuit of Luke, never breaking formation.                 Luke looks anxiously at the exhaust port.                 Vader adjusts his control sticks, checking his projected                 targeting screen.                 Luke's ship barrels down the trench.                 Vader's targeting computer swings around into position. Vader                 takes careful aim on Luke's X-wing fighter.                  He pushes the fire buttons.                 The three TIE fighters move in on Luke. As Vader's center                 fighter unleashes a volley of laserfire, one of the TIE ships                 at his side is hit and explodes into flame. The two remaining                 ships continue to move in.                 Luke looks about, wondering whose laserfire destroyed Vader's                 wingman.                 Vader is taken by surprise, and looks out from his cockpit.                  Vader's wingman searches around him trying to locate the                 unknown attacker.                 Han and Chewbacca grin from ear to ear.                           Yahoo!                 The Millennium Falcon heads right at the two TIE fighters.                  It's a collision course.                 The wingman spots the pirateship coming at him and warns the                 Dark Lord.                  Vader's wingman panics at the sight of the oncoming pirate                 starship and veers radically to one side, colliding with                 Vader's TIE fighter in the process. Vader's wingman crashes                 into the side wall of the trench and explodes. Vader's damaged                 ship spins out of the trench with a damaged wing.                 Vader's ship spins out of control with a bent solar fin,                 heading for deep space.                 Vader turns round and round in circles as his ship spins                 into space.                 Solo's ship moves in toward the Death Star trench.                 Solo, smiling, speaks to Luke over his headset mike.                           You're all clear, kid.                 Leia and the others listen to Solo's transmission.                           Now let's blow this thing and go                           home!                 Luke looks up and smiles. He concentrates on the exhaust                 port, then fires his laser torpedoes.                 Luke's torpedoes shoot toward the port and seems to simply                 disappear into the surface and not explode. But the shots do                 find their mark and have gone into the exhaust port and are                 heading for the main reactor.                 Luke throws his head back in relief.                 An Imperial soldier runs to the control panel board and pulls                 the attack lever as the board behind him lights up.                  Two X-wings, a Y-wing, and the pirateship race toward Yavin                 in the distance.                 Several Imperial soldiers, flanking a pensive Grand Moff                 Tarkin, busily push control levers and buttons.                  The rumble of a distant explosion begins.                 The Rebel ships race out of sight, leaving the moon-like                 Death Star alone against a blanket of stars. Several small                 flashes appear on the surface. The Death Star bursts into a                 supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display.                           million.                 Luke is at ease, and his eyes are closed.                           you... always.                 The ship rocks back and forth.                 Vader's ship spins off into space.                 The Rebel ships race toward the fourth moon of Yavin.                 Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a                 throng of ground crew and pilots. Luke climbs down the ladder                 as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting.                 Princess Leia rushes toward him.                  She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance                 around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace                 one another, slapping each other on the back.                           Hey! Hey!                           I knew you'd come back! I just knew                           it!                           the credit and take all the reward.                 Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves                 at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them.                           Hey, I knew there was more to you                           than money.                 Luke looks toward the ship.                  The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the                 fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.                           something!                               (to mechanic)                          You can repair him, can't you?                            my circuits or gears will help, I'll                           gladly donate them.                  Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main                 temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners                 are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the                 beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly                 march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From                 one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired                 Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to                 an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the                 whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other                 dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is                 dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.                  She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He                 winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who                 is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled                 troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo                 beeps with happiness.  		    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
